<h1>Day 1</h1>
<p>I wake up around 8.  I have 160 km to ride today from Lausanne to Belley.  I'm
not in a hurry. The days are long, weather forecast is sunny, 20 degrees I have
all the time to enjoy my morning coffee while reading the news.</p>
<p>My gear is almost ready.  I'm taking my Ortlieb saddlebag, plus a small frame
bag for the lights and for a spare battery. Should be enough for a multi day
trip.</p>
<p>I'm reviewing what cables to bring. I have a charger cable for my phone, the
Garmin head unit, the pedals with power meter and my shifters. They are all
with different connectors.</p>
<p>It feels strange to have four kinds of batteries in my (non-electric) road
bike. Anyhow, during a 1000km trip I need to be ready to charge their
batteries, so I bring four different cables with me. I pay the price for
choosing the latest tech.</p>
<p>Just before leaving, I remember that my cleats are completely worn, so I change
them quickly before starting to roll.</p>
<p>Until Geneva, I know the road well I don't need sightseeing and I advance well:
60km in 2 hours.</p>
<p>I cross Geneva in the lunchtime peak traffic.  My Garmin takes me through a few
loops, but I don't second guess it because I don't know the city well.</p>
<p>West of Geneva I find the Via Rhône cycling road and the car traffic completely
disappears. The road is well signaled and pretty calm. I cross many cyclists. I
need to stay on this path until Belley where I booked a room for tonight.</p>
<p>At around 15:30 I'm at 100km, and I stop at a bakery.  On the bike I ate a Clif
Bar and two bananas.  Now I pick a grilled vegetable sandwich and a coffee. The
sandwich is huge, tastes great. There's no shade around the bakery, so I finish
it quickly and get rolling. 60 km to go.</p>
<p>I start the see the Rhône next to me. The road goes up and down, there are even
a few longer climbs, but nothing too steep.</p>
<h1>Day 2</h1>
<p>I start the day at 8 A.M. with a typical French breakfast: baguette, butter,
jam, homemade cake with fruit juice and lots of coffee. I have 170 km ahead of
me, I store as much energy as I can.</p>
<p>Rain is forecast, I'm planning to wear with my rain gear.  When I leave it's
covered and wet, but, fortunately, not raining.</p>
<p>I ride three hours, time for lunch!  Just like yesterday I find a boulangerie
at a center of a small town. I pay 9.5 EUR for a sandwich, coke and a cake.</p>
<p>Now it starts raining for real, so I put on my raincoat. It rains for about an
hour at low intensity. Later even the sun comes out!</p>
<p>Today there's more unpaved section than yesterday. Fortunately, the gravel is
well compacted it rolls well.  My bike however becomes filthy.  I'll wash
it tonight.</p>
<p>I cross Lyon along the Rhône. There are walkers, runners and bikers sharing the
large promenade on the banks.  Friday evening traffic is terrible. I need to
pay attention with the heat and the accumulated fatigue.  I arrive to Irigny, a
few km south of Lyon.  There's a short climb to reach the apartment.</p>
<p>I'll spend the next two days in Lyon resting and sightseeing, then starts a <a href="https://training.thewagner.net/blog/2024/06/17/ardeche-tour-2024/">six
day tour in the Ardèche</a>.</p>
