# Preparation

I prepared with a 16 week, self-guided, heart rate based training plan from
[Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com).  This is the third time I train
using a Garmin-generated training plan: I used twice the intermediate versions
with 5 workouts a week and this time I tried the advanced plan with 8 workouts
a week.

On a typical week I had four days with one workout, two days with two workouts
and one rest day.  On double days I trained once before and once after work.
The morning training was almost always a 30 minute easy run.  Sometimes it was
hard to get out of bed and it often felt like too easy and short to be worth
it.  But, especially in the first two months of the preparation, these short
morning runs helped accumulating more weekly kilometers.

In the second half of the preparation I replaced a few recovery runs by cycling
workouts.  I tried not to skip interval sessions and long runs.  Fortunately I
was mostly healthy but I skipped a week of training at the end of March when I
was busy with moving.
