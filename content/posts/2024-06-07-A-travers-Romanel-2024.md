I participated in the running race [A travel Romanel](https://www.atraversromanel.ch/) the first time.  

I finished the 10.5 km race in 42:57.35, corresponding to a 4:11 min/km average
pace.  The race does three laps across Romanel-sur-Lausanne with a total of 140
m of elevation gain.

I had no objectives for this race.  I didn't expect to be in a great running
form.  Since the [20 km de
Lausanne]({filename}2024-04-28-20km-de-Lausanne-2024.md) my training about
cycling and I barely run.  I started the first lap too fast, but in the second
and the third lap I found a steady pace.  The endurance was there, but the
power in the legs was missing on the climbs.

It was a great night out on the first truly warm summer evening of the year.
