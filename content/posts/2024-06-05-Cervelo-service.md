In past two months I rode 780 km with the my [Cervélo Caledonia
5](2024-03-28-Cervelo-Caledonia-5.md).  Today I brought back to the
shop for its first checkup.  Breaks, gears, wheels, and everything else work
well, no problems were found.

The next planned maintenance is after about 4000 km where it's recommended to
change the chain.

Looking forward to riding this bike more.
