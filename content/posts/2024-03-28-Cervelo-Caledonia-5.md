Today I bought a new [Cervélo Caledonia 5](https://www.cervelo.com/en-CH/bikes/caledonia-5).  I ordered it with Shimano Di2 Ultegra set and Reserve 40/44 wheels.

The disc brakes and the electronic shifting represent a huge step up from my 2010 Cervélo R3.  The R3 was a climber's bike, the Caledonia is marketed as an endurance model.  After a few rides I'm convinced that the Caledonia's frame geometry suits well for my outings.

Additonally, with the purchase I was offered a professional bike fit, this also contributes to the better comfort.
