Today I got back [my road bike]({filename}2024-03-28-Cervelo-Caledonia-5.md)
from the bike shop after its 4000 km maintenance.  As far for regular
maintenance nothing surprising: they replaced the chain, brakes, tyres and the
handle bar straps.

Unfortunately, earlier this year I damaged my frame during a wash.  After a
rainy ride I wanted to clean the bike in our flat's big laundry sink.  The bike
slipped, and the frame hit the concrete basin's edge.  The shock appears to
cause only a nick, but my bike mechanic noticed a tiny crack that needed a
specialist's help.

My bike mechanic recommended a person specializing in carbon repair.  He did an
excellent job and the bike looks like new.
