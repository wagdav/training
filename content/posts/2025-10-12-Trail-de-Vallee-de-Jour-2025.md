I close the running season with [Trail de Vallée de
Joux](http://trailvalleedejoux.ch/), which I run the third time today.  I felt
untrained for running on the trains.  I arrived pretty cooked at the finish
line with a time much slower than in [2019][TDVJ2019] and 2018.

Perfect weather, beautiful sunshine on the Mont Tendre and in the finish line.

During the first hour the climb feels hard, but I climb steadily. On the way
down my legs feel heavy and tired, I fall twice, so I just take it easy.
