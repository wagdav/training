# Preparation

I followed the same training plan [as last year](2024-04-28-20km-de-Lausanne-2024.md), a 16 week long, self-guided,
heart rate based training plan from [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com).
I felt motivated during the entire preparation and I didn't feel extreme highs or lows.

I feel the plan worked out perfectly.  I missed three trainings because of a
mild flu and I skipped a few optional sessions when I felt tired.  In total, I
ran 1069 km in four months.

The training plan included two preparatory races, but I didn't find any
suitable event nearby.  Instead, I traced a somewhat flat, 10k course from
Cully to Vevey and I used this as a race simulation.  Both times I ran the 10km
in exactly 40 minutes.

By the end of week five I felt the accumulated fatigue and I had a hard time
starting the long run on Sunday.  I introduced an extra rest day the feeling
during training quickly improved.

On double days, I found the easy runs in the morning more refreshing than last
year.  Also, my body reacted well to strenuous weeks 9, 10 and 11, each with
almost 80 km workout.
