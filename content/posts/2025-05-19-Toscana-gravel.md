Six of us went for a five-day bikepacking gravel cycling trip in Tuscany.  The
tour started and ended in Siena.

# Sunday

We aim to start at 7 am from Lausanne.  We have two cars with three cyclist
each and four bikes in total plus luggage.  Riccardo and I plan to rent bikes
in Siena, the others bring their own bikes.

Kees brings Mr Ride, an old mountain bike, from the Netherlands but during a
Mollendruz-Marchariuz prologue the day before, he decides against using it for
the trip.  Riccardo orders an emergency Bianchi for him.  This makes three of
us renting gravel bikes in Siena.  The others use their endurance road bike
with 32 mm tyres.

I buy bread and pastry for the group at Chez Manu, a bakery nearby where I used
to live.  We finish loading the cars and we start our 700km drive towards
Siena.

# Monday

We walk to the [Siena Bike Shop][BikeShop] to pick-up our gravel bikes.  They
rent us three Bianchis with 40mm gravel tyres.  It takes an hour to set
everything up: the mechanic mounts our pedals, we adjust the seat height and
install our bike bags.

We leave the cars in the parking garage of the Siena train station where the
parking costs only 2â‚¬ per day.

We start pedalling around eleven.  We get excited on the first gravel sectors.
The bikes roll well on the dry, compacted white roads.

At about halfway we have lunch on a [beautiful terrace in Murlo][Day1Lunch].

Some french tourist ask for the Gladiator House which we miss.  Martijn has a
flat which he quickly repairs.

Before the last climb of the day we stop in Bagno Vignoni.

Riccardo and I do the proper path with 15-20% bits.

Dinner in a family restaurant.
