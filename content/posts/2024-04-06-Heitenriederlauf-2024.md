10.2 km race [Heitenried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heitenried) as preparation for this year's [20 km de Lausanne](/blog/2024/04/28/20km-de-lausanne-2024).  The race is on gravel and asphalt roads with approximately 180m of elevation gain.

I was 16th at the finish line (6th in my age category) with a time 40:57. This is an average pace of 4 min/km pace which is my best result at a race with such altitude profile.
